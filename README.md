## A new way to walk, bike, and run

If you are new to a city with an uneven terrain, you have been through the pain of learning which route to take works best for you. Especially, if you walk, run, or bike to work, school, just getting around, or for fitness reasons.

I have taken routes based on the recommendations of the mapping app on my phone and realized after many iterations that they had no idea how I prefered my routes. The steeper the slope with few trees on the way, the less likely I'm going to be taking the route. 

This app will help you help you customize your route effortlessly based on the criteria you choose, or based on the routes you have taken in the past. 

If you have trouble walking/running/biking on steep slopes, would like to go through the nature, avoid delays of waiting on red-light stops, would like to avoid stairs, and/or have some shade due to the weather, just change the criteria on your app and the app will design a custom route to make your commute amazingly pleasant.

Also, if you are training for a competition and would like to train on a slope, that could be arranged too.
